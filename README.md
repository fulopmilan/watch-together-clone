# watchtogether clone (quarantine-tflix)

this is a clone of a video-watching site to show my skills using the MERN stack.
it lets you watch content from various streaming platforms with your friends

## it does
- sync videos in real-time
- have a built-in chat
- have a built-in user list, and you can also change your name
- have a function for changing hosts, or kicking unwanted users temporarily

## good to know:
- it's not great on phones right now
- there might be some little issues
- i might come back to this project later and upgrade it later with some new features

## future ideas:
- tweaks on front-end
- "share url" button
- function to save volume and username on local storage
- random username generation of pre-defined words, instead of using IDs as default username
- mobile support
